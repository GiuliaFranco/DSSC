reserve gpu

2 software : driver and cuda-tool-kit ---> new tool kit every 6 months (use last version available)

1- module load cudatoolkit/10.0

Inside the cudatoolkit/10.0, the samples folder there's a collection of open source code mostly used.

2- qsub -q gpu -l walltime=1:00:00,nodes=1:ppn=20 -I

2.a- nvidia-smi  //info about the gpu in the machine and the processes running.

2.b- nvidia-smi topo -mp  //reveals the topology of the socket: GPUs closest to some CPUs. In this way we can choose the closest one that minimize bandwidth.

NB: I can run a gpu code even without gpu if the driver is installed but i'll return random values.
